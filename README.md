I created the files: index.html, style.css, script.js
index.html conected with style.css use   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
index.html conected with script.js use  <script src="script.js"></script>
index.html  and style.css did bootstrap
in index.html press b4 after choosen b4-$, This is a template of.index.html
I did index.html scructure greating function name calculateDiff(), which after using in script.js
insert font from google and did style.css structure
